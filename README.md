# Data Analysis of Telecom Customer Churn

This [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset) comes from an Iranian telecom company, with each row representing a customer over a year period. Along with a churn label, there is information on the customers' activity, such as call failures and subscription length.

## Scenario

You have just been hired by a telecom company. A competitor has recently entered the market and is offering an attractive plan to new customers. The telecom company is worried that this competitor may start attracting its customers.

You have access to a dataset of the company's customers, including whether customers churned. The telecom company wants to know whether you can use this data to predict whether a customer will churn. They also want to know what factors increase the probability that a customer churns.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
